A gardener needs to buy some turf for a project
they are working on. The garden is rectangular
with a circular flower bed in the middle.
Write a program that:
• asks the user for the dimensions of the lawn
and the radius of the circle (in metres)
• uses a function to calculate and output
the amount of turf needed
